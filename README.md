# Typing Speed Test

I developed this typing speed tester using HTML5, CSS, DOM and Javascript. The tester displays words in English and Ukrainian. WPM and accuracy are calculated at the end of the test. By adding application customization buttons:
1. it is possible to add sound accompaniment to keystrokes;
2. change the theme;
3. the ability to connect a visual keyboard;
It is possible to connect to the built-in spotify player and enjoy great music while learning to type.
